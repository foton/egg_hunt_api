Mysterious Ruby Backend

This project should be written in Ruby and created and put on Github or Bitbucket. The subject is not important, and can be anything and everything. Merely the below stated requirements must be fulfilled:

It must be API (REST, JSON).
It must be secured by basic auth.
It must contain User mode - with different roles (admin, user, guest).
It must limit access to given part of API depending on User role.
Admin has access to everything.
User can read all, create all, but update and deleted only his records.
Guest has only read access.
There should be at least 2 different models except User.
Those models should be in relation (1 to many).
Seeds file with at least one record of sample data for each model.

Within this assessment, the following skills will be assessed:
Ruby on Rails
API Design / REST
OOP / Clean Code / SOLID
Testing
Web Development

Should anything be unclear or should you have any concerns or questions generally, please do get in touch.

Bonus points
If you feel strong as a full stack developer please build a CRUD web app (with login) that consumes the API described above. Please use your preferred UI JavaScript library.

Good luck - and enjoy!
